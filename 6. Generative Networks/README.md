### **Project 6: Generative Networks**

This project explored the power of generative deep learning models for creative tasks. The researchers implemented two specific architectures: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and CycleGANs. VAEs are adept at learning the underlying structure of data and generating new variations that stay true to the original style. For instance, a VAE trained on images of cats could generate new images of cats, perhaps with different fur patterns or poses.

CycleGANs, on the other hand, excel at translating data from one domain to another. Imagine training a CycleGAN on pairs of images, one showing a person and the other a corresponding painting. The CycleGAN would then be able to transform images of people into paintings and vice versa. This project likely involved training VAEs and CycleGANs on specific datasets to showcase their unique generative capabilities.
