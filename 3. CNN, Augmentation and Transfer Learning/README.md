### **Project 3: CNN, Augmentation and Transfer Learning**

This project investigated using deep learning for image classification and object detection. First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was built to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains images of everyday objects like airplanes and cars. To improve the CNN's performance, the researchers explored data augmentation techniques. These techniques artificially create variations of existing images, such as rotating them or flipping them horizontally. This helps the CNN learn more generalizable features that are less sensitive to small variations in the images. Finally, the project went beyond classification and adapted a pre-trained Xception network for object detection. Fine-tuning involves taking a network trained on a large dataset like ImageNet and adjusting it for a specific task with a smaller dataset like CIFAR-10. This leverages the power of the pre-trained network while allowing it to specialize in the new task.
