## Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course Projects (Tehran University)

This repository contains the projects I completed for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course at the University of Tehran.

**Getting Started**

- This repository assumes you have Python and a deep learning framework like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras installed.

**Contents**

This repository includes folders for each project.  Each folder will likely contain:

- Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts implementing the project.
- Data files used for training and testing (if applicable).
- README.md file (optional, for project-specific details).

**Project Descriptions**

**1. Neural Networks Basics**

This project provided a foundational understanding of neural networks

**2. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

Building upon the basics, this project focused on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs).

**3. CNN, Augmentation and Transfer Learning**

This project delved into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a powerful architecture for image recognition. 

**4. YOLO**

This project focused on YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system. 

**5. Time Series**

This project explored Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their variants, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). These networks excel at handling sequential data Applications in tasks like time series forecasting and sentiment analysis

**6. Generative Networks**

This project introduced generative models, a fascinating area of deep learning that can create new data:

- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their training process
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for learning data representations

**7. Memory Networks**

This project might have covered memory networks, a less common architecture but with interesting capabilities:

**8. Some Other Networks**

This project might have allowed you to explore other interesting Neural Networks beyond the ones covered previously.
