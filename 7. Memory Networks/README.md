### **Project 7: Building Memory Networks**

In this project, we explore memory-building methods that enhance neural networksâ€™ capacity to retain information. Our focus lies on four key techniques:

1. **Hub Method**: Inspired by neural interconnectedness, the Hub method establishes a central hub for efficient communication between network components. It aids memory consolidation and retrieval.
2. **Self-Association Networks**: These networks learn to associate related concepts, mimicking human memory connections. They recognize patterns and infer missing details.
3. **Hopfield Network**: Named after physicist John Hopfield, this model stores memories as stable attractor states. It excels at content-addressable memory retrieval.
4. **Bidirectional Associative Memory (BAM)**: BAM networks establish bidirectional connections between input and output layers, facilitating associative recall.
