### **Project 8: S**ome Other Networks

In this project, we explore four neural networks:

1. **MaxNet Algorithm**: A powerful optimization tool that adjusts neuron weights to find maximum activation. It excels in image recognition, clustering, and function approximation.
2. **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)**: An unsupervised network organizing input data into a grid, revealing data patterns and facilitating exploration.
3. **Mexican Hat and Hamming Net**: These intriguingly named networks specialize in edge detection, contour recognition, and associative memory tasks.
